## What you'll learn

The course helps students develop an appreciation for programming as a problem solving tool. 
It teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently, and serves as the foundation for further computer science studies. 
Using a project-based approach, students will learn to manipulate variables, expressions, and statements in Python, and understand functions, loops, and iterations. 
Students will then dive deep into data structures such as strings, files, lists, dictionaries, and tuples to write complex programs. Over the course of the term, students will learn and apply basic data structures and algorithmic thinking. 
Throughout the course, students will be exposed to abstraction and will learn a systematic way of constructing solutions to problems. 
They will work on team projects to practice pair programming, code reviews, and other collaboration methods common to industry. 
The course culminates in a final group project in which students demonstrate and reflect on their learning.

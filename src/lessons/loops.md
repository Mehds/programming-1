# Loops

We often want code to run again and again, until it’s time to stop. We might need to run part of the program for a certain number of time or as long as some condition is true. In this weeks’s lessons, we will learn how to do that using loops.

Loops reduce the amount of code you need to write. Instead of having to type out the same thing again and again, or run your program many times, you can use a loop to repeat your code instead.

More than just saving you time as a programmer, loops let you tap into the computer's superpower: _speed_.

## Summary

- loops let you repeat code, letting you use the computer's speed
- `while` repeats code for as long as a condition is True
- `for` repeats code for a specific number of iterations
- `range` lets us control the start, end, and step size of a `for` loop
- You can debug loops using `print`, or by stepping through the code with a debugger like pythontutor

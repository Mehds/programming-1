# Conditional Statements

Programs need to be able to do different things, depending on the circumstances.  _Conditional Statements_ are the programmer's tool for writing code that can make decisions.

The kinds of decisions will vary, from "is this number even?" to "did the user input the correct password?", but they all boil down to a set of yes-or-no questions.

In Python, the data type for representing yes-or-no _answers_ is the Boolean: `True` or `False`.

## Summary

- `if` statements let us write code that makes decisions
- We can use comparison operators like `==`, `<`, `>` to compare values and get `True` or `False`
- `elif` and `else` blocks let us handle more complicated branching situations
- We can combine booleans expressions with `and`, `or`, and `not`

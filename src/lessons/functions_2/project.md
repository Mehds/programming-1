## Individual Project: Quick Draw

**Due date: TBD**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

In this project, you will be asked to implement quick draw game to see how fast is a user by clicking enter when reading a string value.
**Access** the assignment in Replit here: <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://replit.com/@fpwp-projects/Quick-Draw-MuawiyaAsali1#main.py" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

[TODO: Maybe we can modify the string to be a global variable? @Muawiya @Rob]

[TODO: Create a video to solve the project? @Muawiya]

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord

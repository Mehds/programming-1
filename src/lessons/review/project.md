## Individual Project: Robot Message Construction - RMC

**Due date: TBD**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

In this project, you will asked to assist an operational engineer to understand what commands are to be performed for each robot type.
You will be asked to process general instructions into a command file.
**Access** the assignment in Replit here: https://github.com/moawiah/Robot_Message_Construction

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord

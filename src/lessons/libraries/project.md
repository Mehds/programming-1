# Project

**Due date: TBD**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Message Encode & Decode

In this project, you will implement a program to encode and decode messages, and 
build a simple Web UI for the results using Flask.

**Access** the assignment here: https://github.com/kiboschool/message-encode-decode

[TODO: Create a video to solve the project? @Muawiya]

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord

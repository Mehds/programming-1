## Individual Project: Message Encode & Decode Phase 2

**Due date: TBD**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

I this project, you will be asked to implement phase two for the Message Encode/Decode project. 
You need to use utility functions that you already built in Function-2 week to build a free style web application.
**Access** the assignment in Replit here: https://github.com/moawiah/Message_Encode_Decode

[TODO: Create a video to solve the project? @Muawiya]

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord

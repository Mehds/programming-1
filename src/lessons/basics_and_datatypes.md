# Basics and Datatypes

In these lessons, you'll get up and running with Python.

If you've never programmed before, there's a few questions you probably have:

* What is a program?
* How do I write and run programs?

We'll try to answer those questions, and by the end of this chapter, you'll be 
writing and running programs of your own. They'll start simple, but you'll use 
what you learn for the rest of your time with Python.

Part of getting started is learning how Python represents data. The other focus
of these first few lessons will be the basic Python _data types_, what they are 
for, and how to convert between them.

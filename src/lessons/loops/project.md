# Project

**Due date: TBD**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.


## Guess My Number

ðŸ”¢ Write a program that asks a user to guess the value of a number chosen between 1 and 99. Let the user know if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

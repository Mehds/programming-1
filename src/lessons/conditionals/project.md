## Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this assignment, you'll recreate the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. If youâ€™ve never played before, or need a refresher: two players each choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. They show their choice at the same time. Depending on their choice, thereâ€™s a win, lose, or draw.

- Rock smashes Scissors
- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- If the two choices are the same, itâ€™s a draw
- Rock, Paper, and Scissors are the only choices allowed.

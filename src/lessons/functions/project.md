## Individual Project: Quick Draw

**Due date: TBD**

ðŸ’¡ This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

In this project, you will be asked to implement quick draw game to see how fast is a user by clicking enter when reading a string value.
